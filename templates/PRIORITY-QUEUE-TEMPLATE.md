## How to Use This Template

### 1. Update Daily
Your AI should check this file and update task status. Completed items move to your done log or memory files.

### 2. Prioritization Rules
- **URGENT:** Must be done by specific date, has external dependencies
- **This Week:** Important for current sprint/goals
- **This Month:** Planned work that supports larger objectives
- **Blocked:** Waiting on others, but important to track
- **Ongoing:** Recurring tasks that need regular attention
- **[PROJECT CATEGORY]:** Future work, ideas, someday/maybe items

### 3. AI Instructions
Your AI should:
- Reference this file when you ask "what should I work on?"
- Suggest moving completed items to appropriate categories
- Flag when urgent items are approaching deadlines
- Recommend breaking large tasks into smaller actionable steps

### 4. Weekly Review
Every week, review and reorganize:
- Move completed items to done
- Promote monthly items to weekly if needed
- Add new items from ongoing projects
- Update deadlines and dependencies

### Example Entries

Instead of: `- [ ] Website stuff`
Write: `- [ ] **Homepage redesign** — New layout for better conversion, draft due Friday`

Instead of: `- [ ] Call John`  
Write: `- [ ] **Client check-in with John** — Q1 project status, budget approval needed`

This system gives your AI clear context about what matters most and when things need to happen.
