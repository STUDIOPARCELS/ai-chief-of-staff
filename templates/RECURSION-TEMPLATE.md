## The Loop
```
MEASURE → ANALYZE → HYPOTHESIZE → BUILD → VERIFY → PERSIST
   ↑                                                    |
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each cycle's output feeds the next cycle's input. Your AI doesn't just log — it structurally improves.

## What Gets Measured (Daily)
- **Errors:** Your corrections, failed tasks, wrong assumptions
- **Friction:** Tasks that took too long, required retries, hit walls
- **Wins:** Tasks completed smoothly, approved first try
- **Tools:** What was used vs. what was needed but missing
- **[CUSTOM METRIC 1]:** [WHAT YOU WANT TO TRACK FOR YOUR BUSINESS]
- **[CUSTOM METRIC 2]:** [WHAT YOU WANT TO TRACK FOR YOUR BUSINESS]

## How It Compounds
- **Day 1-7:** Establish baselines. Log everything.
- **Week 2-4:** Identify patterns. What errors recur? What's slow?
- **Month 2+:** Build systems that make failure categories impossible.

## Improvement Types (cheapest to most expensive)
1. **Document fix** — Update identity/protocol files (free)
2. **Process fix** — Add checklist or pre-flight step (free)
3. **Script fix** — Automate a manual step (cheap)
4. **Tool fix** — Add new capability or integration (medium)
5. **Architecture fix** — Redesign how operations work (expensive, high ROI)

## Active Hypotheses
*Format: IF [change] THEN [metric] IMPROVES BY [estimate]*

**H1:** IF [PROPOSED CHANGE] THEN [WHAT SHOULD IMPROVE] BY [HOW MUCH] [MEASURING STATUS]
**H2:** IF [PROPOSED CHANGE] THEN [WHAT SHOULD IMPROVE] BY [HOW MUCH] [MEASURING STATUS]
**H3:** IF [PROPOSED CHANGE] THEN [WHAT SHOULD IMPROVE] BY [HOW MUCH] [MEASURING STATUS]

## Verified Improvements
*Format: [date] [change made] → [measured result]*

- [DATE]: [IMPROVEMENT DESCRIPTION] → [MEASURED OUTCOME]

## How to Use This Template

1. **Daily:** Have your AI log what worked, what broke, what it learned
2. **Weekly:** Review patterns and create hypotheses for improvement  
3. **Monthly:** Analyze verified improvements and update capabilities
4. **Always:** Feed learnings back into your AI's identity and protocols

### Example Hypothesis
Instead of: `IF better prompts THEN better results`
Write: `IF task context included in every request THEN error rate drops 50% in 2 weeks [TESTING]`

### Example Verified Improvement
Instead of: `Made AI better at email`
Write: `2026-02-15: Added email triage checklist → 90% reduction in "urgent" false alarms`

This system turns your AI from a tool that forgets into a system that compounds its effectiveness daily.
