## Phase 1: Foundation (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Workspace (5 minutes)

Create a folder structure for your AI's memory:

```
your-business/
├── CLAUDE.md          # Your AI's identity  
├── COMPANY.md         # Business structure
├── PRIORITY-QUEUE.md  # Task management
├── RECURSION.md       # Learning system
├── memory/            # Daily logs
├── projects/          # Project files
└── templates/         # Reusable documents
```

**Pro tip:** Use Dropbox, Google Drive, or any synced folder so your AI can access files from anywhere you work.

### Step 2: Define Your AI's Identity (10 minutes)

1. **Copy CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md** → rename to **CLAUDE.md**
2. **Fill in all [BRACKETS]** with your specific information:
   - Your name, role, and background
   - Your active projects (3-5 current priorities)
   - Your communication preferences  
   - Your technical setup
3. **Test it:** Start a new AI chat, paste the entire CLAUDE.md content, and ask: "What are my top priorities this week?"

**Success indicator:** Your AI should respond with specific context about YOUR projects, not generic advice.

### Step 3: Set Up Task Management (10 minutes)

1. **Copy PRIORITY-QUEUE-TEMPLATE.md** → rename to **PRIORITY-QUEUE.md**
2. **Add your actual tasks** in appropriate categories:
   - URGENT: Deadline-driven items
   - This Week: Current sprint goals
   - This Month: Pipeline work
   - Blocked: Waiting on others
   - Ongoing: Recurring responsibilities
3. **Test it:** Ask your AI: "Based on my priority queue, what should I focus on today?"

### Step 4: Initialize Learning System (5 minutes)

1. **Copy RECURSION-TEMPLATE.md** → rename to **RECURSION.md**
2. **Customize the measurement categories** for your business type
3. **Add 1-2 initial hypotheses** about what might improve your workflow
4. **Create memory folder:** `mkdir memory/`

## Phase 2: Business Structure (45 minutes)

### Step 5: Define Your Organization (20 minutes)

1. **Copy COMPANY-TEMPLATE.md** → rename to **COMPANY.md**
2. **Set up cost tiers** based on your AI platform:

**For ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro users:**
- Executive: Your main account (for strategy, client work)
- Manager: Your main account (for implementation)
- Assistant: Free models like ChatGPT 3.5 or Gemini (for research)

**For API users:**
- Executive: GPT-4 or Claude Opus (expensive, high quality)
- Manager: GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet (mid-range)
- Assistant: GPT-3.5 or Claude Haiku (cheap, good enough)

3. **Define your projects/divisions** with clear missions and quality gates
4. **Customize the standing orders** to match your work style

### Step 6: Create Quality Gates (15 minutes)

For each project area, define what "done" looks like:

**Example for Consulting Work:**
- [ ] Client name and context correct?
- [ ] Deliverable addresses the actual question asked?
- [ ] Professional formatting and no typos?
- [ ] Follow-up actions clearly defined?

**Example for Creative Work:**
- [ ] Meets creative brief requirements?
- [ ] Files properly named and organized?
- [ ] Version control maintained?
- [ ] Client approval process initiated?

### Step 7: Set Communication Protocols (10 minutes)

Define how your AI should handle different scenarios:
- When to ask for approval vs. proceed independently
- How to escalate urgent issues  
- Preferred communication channels and timing
- Templates for common responses

---

## Phase 3: Automation & Memory (30 minutes)

### Step 8: Morning Briefing System (15 minutes)

1. **Copy MORNING-BRIEFING-TEMPLATE.md** 
2. **Customize the key areas** for your business:
   - Replace [YOUR KEY AREA 1/2/3] with your actual focus areas
   - Define what sources should be checked
   - Set your preferred briefing length and format
3. **Test it:** Ask your AI to deliver a morning briefing using your template

### Step 9: Memory System Setup (10 minutes)

1. **Create your first memory file:** `memory/2026-[TODAY'S DATE].md`
2. **Add today's key information:**
   - Projects worked on
   - Decisions made  
   - Problems encountered
   - Lessons learned
3. **Train your AI:** "At the end of each session, update today's memory file with key developments"

### Step 10: Initial Testing (5 minutes)

Run these tests to verify everything works:

```
Test 1: "What are my current projects and their status?"
Test 2: "Deliver my morning briefing"  
Test 3: "Based on my priority queue, recommend today's focus"
Test 4: "What have I accomplished this week?" (check memory)
Test 5: "How can we improve our workflow?" (check learning)
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (15 minutes)

### Step 11: Cost Optimization (10 minutes)

**For API Users:**
- Set up usage tracking to monitor costs per project
- Create rules for when to use expensive vs. cheap models
- Test delegation: have your main AI assign simple tasks to cheaper models

**For Platform Users:**
- Use free models for research and data gathering
- Reserve premium accounts for final output and client work
- Create multiple accounts if needed for cost management

### Step 12: Integration Setup (5 minutes)

Connect your AI to your actual business tools:

**Email:** Grant access to check and send emails on your behalf  
**Calendar:** Allow scheduling and conflict detection  
**Project Tools:** Connect to Notion, Asana, Trello, etc.  
**Files:** Ensure access to your business documents  
**Communication:** Set up notifications via Slack, Discord, SMS  

*Note: Only grant permissions you're comfortable with. Start minimal and expand.*

## Daily Operations

### Your New Routine

**Morning (5 minutes):**
1. Ask for your daily briefing
2. Review priority queue updates
3. Confirm today's focus areas

**During Work:**
- Delegate research and routine tasks to your AI
- Ask for progress updates on complex projects  
- Use your AI to draft communications and documents

**End of Day (5 minutes):**
1. Update memory file with key developments
2. Review what worked well and what didn't
3. Update priority queue for tomorrow

**Weekly (15 minutes):**
1. Review memory files and extract patterns
2. Update RECURSION.md with lessons learned
3. Refine templates and protocols based on results

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "My AI forgets things between sessions"
**Solution:** Start every session by asking your AI to read CLAUDE.md, today's memory file, and PRIORITY-QUEUE.md

### "Responses are too generic"
**Solution:** Add more specific examples and context to your CLAUDE.md identity file

### "AI costs are too high"
**Solution:** Use the cost tier system - delegate simple tasks to cheaper models

### "Quality is inconsistent"  
**Solution:** Strengthen your quality gates in COMPANY.md and always verify before delivery

### "AI makes the same mistakes repeatedly"
**Solution:** Update RECURSION.md with specific error patterns and prevention steps

---

## Success Metrics

Track these weekly to measure improvement:

- **Time saved:** Hours per week returned to strategic work
- **Error rate:** Corrections needed per AI output
- **Cost efficiency:** Results per dollar spent on AI
- **Response quality:** Client/stakeholder satisfaction
